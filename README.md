## What is MAI?
High-throughput computational catalysis typically involves the calculation of many different adsorption energies. MAI is a tool meant to automate the process of constructing reasonable initial guesses for adsorbates in MOFs for the purposes of DFT screening workflows. For implementing a high-throughput DFT workflow, refer to our [PyMOFScreen](https://github.com/arosen93/mof_screen) code.

## Documentation and Details
Please check out the [ReadTheDocs](https://mai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page for documentation on how to use MAI.
