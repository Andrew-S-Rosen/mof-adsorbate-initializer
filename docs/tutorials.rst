Tutorials
=========

It is probably best to lead by example, so in this tutorial I will walk you through a few examples meant to highlight MAI's capabilities and get you up to speed. Each one progressively builds on the one prior, so if you're new around here, I recommend you start at the top. Let's get started! In addition to the tutorials shown here, please refer to the ``examples`` folder in the main MAI directory for example scripts you can run and play around with.
