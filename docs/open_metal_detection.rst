Open Metal Detection
====================
In the previous examples, we manually specified the desired adsorption site via the :mod:`site_idx` argument. In practice, it is often more desirable to have an automated approach to determining which atom in a MOF is the desired adsorption site. For binding at open metal sites in MOFs, this can be done using the OpenMetalDetector_ (OMD) code.

It should be noted that due to the flexibility of MAI, it is possible to use other codes to determine your desired adsorption site. For instance, Zeo++ can detect open metal sites in MOFs, and if you parse the .omsex files generated by Zeo++, you can tell MAI what the :mod:`site_idx` is, in addition to the :mod:`NN_indices` in (NOTE: FILL THIS OUT.)
